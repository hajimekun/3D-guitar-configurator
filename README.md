# 3D guitar configurator

This is a 3D guitar configurator which user can customize the guitar look according to user preferences. This guitar configurator is made purposely to help guitarist around the world visualize what their guitar will look like.

I came up with this idea because a lot of guitar company just uses a simple form for guitarists to customize and describe their guitar specification. It will become so hard to the customer to really visualize the actual product. So with this configurator, the customer will be able to customize their guitar according to their taste.

# How to open configurator?

You can simply donwload this repo and just open the `index.html` file to Mozilla Firefox Browser. Chrome cannot load the 3D library because of CORS. And I don't know why. I will look into this matter later on.
